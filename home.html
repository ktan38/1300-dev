      <h1>Development</h1>
      <p class = "text">
        For this project, I decided to build DreamBuilder, which allows you to build your dream all-time basketball team.
      </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p class = "text"> 
      DreamBuilder is made for avid NBA fans with a deep understanding of its rich history. The app lists 50 of the greatest basketball players ever, with a cost given to each player. The cost was
      determined by a combination of how popular the player was/is and how "great" the player's career was, as evaluated by me. The user is told to play the role of an NBA GM, and use "$60" to construct
      the best starting five possible given the cost constraints. The filtering and sorting features make this a much smoother process for the user, as the user might want to narrow their search to specific
      costs and positions. The total cost of the players is aggregated and displayed in the "My Team" section, where the user can clearly see who has beenn added to their team. 

    </p>
    <h2>Usability Pinciples</h2>
    <p class = "text">
      <ul class = "list">
        <li class = "bullet">Cards are laid out in a grid format for effective organization
        </li>
        <li class = "bullet">Player names are bolded for a sense of hierarchy, the player name is the most important part of each card
        </li>
        <li class = "bullet">h1 headers to label each of the two main columns: the card library and the aggregated section, clearly distinguishes the two sections
        </li>
        <li class = "bullet">All buttons and dropdowns clearly shown in blue, stands out from everything else. All buttons are consistent in color so that the user doesn't get confused
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
